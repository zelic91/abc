            <h5>Cookies</h5>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

            <h5>Service Providers</h5>
            <p>
                I may employ third-party companies and
                individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I want to inform users of this Service
                that these third parties have access to your Personal
                Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

            <h5>Security</h5>
            <p>
                I value your trust in providing us your
                Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <h5>Links to Other Sites</h5>
            <p>
                This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                that these external sites are not operated by me.
                Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                services.

            <h5>Children’s Privacy</h5>
            <p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                me with personal information, I immediately
                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                personal information, please contact me so that
                I will be able to do necessary actions.
            </p>
